Besides the physics simulation itself, applications often need to perform specific actions when some particular events
occur inside of the physics world. For example, we might want to generate sounds when two solids collide, or open a
door when a player comes close to it, detect when a projectile hits a target, etc. To allow those kinds of actions, it
is possible to know when two objects start/stop colliding.

In addition, a special kind of collider, called [sensors](#sensors) that do not generate any contacts points, but will detect when they
start/stop touching another collider (be it another sensor or not). This is often useful to detect, e.g., that a player
entered a specific area.

Finally it is possible to retrieve at any time the set of colliders interacting with another collider using various
[iterators](#interaction-iterators) provided by the contact and intersection graphs.

## Sensors
Sensors are a special type of [collider](/docs/user_guides/rust/rigid_body_simulation#colliders) that don't generate any contact.
Like regular colliders, they have to be added to the `ColliderSet`, are given a geometric shape, and are attached to a rigid-body.
They are commonly used for detecting intersection, e.g., to detect when a player enters a
specific area or is close to a door.

The creation of a sensor is identical to the creation of a regular collider except that its sensor flag is set to `true`:

```rust
let sensor = ColliderBuilder::ball(0.5)
    .sensor(true)
    .build();
// Add to the collider set.
let sensor_handle = collider_set.insert(sensor, parent_body, &mut body_set);
```

As presented in the next [section](event_handling_and_sensors/#event-handling) sensors and regular colliders both
generate events of different types to distinguish events due to contacts from events due to sensors.

<!--
:::note
Because sensors are just special cases of colliders, they can be given a specific **collision group** so they
generate events only with a subset of sensors and colliders. The procedure for setting up collision groups is the
same as for regular colliders as described in [that section](rigid_body_simulations_with_contacts/#collision-groups).

## Interaction handling
In order to handle physics events, it is necessary to collect them using a structure implementing the `EventHandler` trait.
Because **Rapier** can be parallelized, this event handler must be `Send + Sync`. One such structure provided by `Rapier`
is the `pipeline::ChannelEventCollector`. This event collector contains channels from the
[crossbeam crate](https://crates.io/crates/crossbeam). These channels will be populated with events during each call
to `pipeline.step`:

:::note
Contact and intersection events identify the involved colliders by their handle. It is possible to retrieve the handle of
the body a collider is attached to: `colliders.get(collider_handle).unwrap().parent()`.

### Intersection events
Intersection events are triggered when two sensors, or one collider and one sensor,
transition between intersecting or not.

One intersection event has the type `ProximityEvent`:

| Field         | Description |
|--             | --          |
| `collider1`   | The handle of the first collider/sensor involved in the intersection. |
| `collider2`   | The handle of the second collider/sensor involved in the intersection. |
| `intersecting` | Set to `true` if the colliders are intersecting. |

### Contact events
Contact events are triggered when two colliders transition between having zero contact points and at least one.
Transitioning between one to more than one contact points is not reported.

An iterator through all contact events may be retrieved by the `.contact_events()`
method of the `World`. The yielded `ContactEvent` enum has two variants:

1. `ContactEvent::Started(h1, h2)` to indicate the transition between
0 to at least one contact point.
2. `ContactEvent::Stopped(h1, h2)` to indicate the transition between
at least one contact point to 0.

Here `h1` and `h2` identify the handles of the colliders involved in the contact.
